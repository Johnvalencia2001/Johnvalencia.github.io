    <p> 	As a professional businessman who takes the client’s, employer’s, and peer’s work very seriously, I consider two of my most important traits to be honest and fair; obviously, there are many other essential traits that should be talked about that are equally or even more critical. But, personally, these two are some of the most significant because they're hard to find in many people, especially when they’re involved in the business of things, in whatever industry that is. In all of my projects, I pledge to be honest with my co-workers or clients at all times and assure them that whatever needs to be done to make their contribution worth their time will be done. It’s in my best interest to successfully meet the requirements of both of these traits because if I do, there’s a high chance that my project and business will strive further on. As for the business as a whole, I believe the three most important characteristics of a successful and trustworthy business are unique values, efficient marketing, and strong visions. First, unique value is fundamental because, as a business company, you have to differentiate yourself from the opponents; what can you offer that’s different? Whether it is price, the value of the end product, or connections. Second, efficient marketing is a no-brainer for making your business go out there, and have people find out who you are and what you do. This kind of attention can make your business grow and become what you never thought it could.</p>
